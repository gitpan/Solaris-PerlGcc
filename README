Solaris/PerlGcc version 1.1
============================

perlgcc - Compile perl modules using gcc.

The perl 5.005_03 and 5.6.1 shipped with Solaris 8, 9 and 10 were built with
the Forte compilers, and therefore assume that any add-on modules will also be
built with the Forte compiler.  The C<perlcc> command will allow gcc to be used
to compile add-on modules for use with the perl versions shipped with Solaris.
